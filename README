# Todoodle!

This is a super-sweet Android app for a todo list. It's my first Android app ever!

- [x] Bonus: Priority field that gets a default when a task is added and updates via Spinner widget
- [x] Bonus: Color-coded entries based on priority
- [x] Misc: Don't add a blank item

### Time

12 hours spent in total:

- 2.5 downloading and configuring dev environment
- 1.5 working through initial tutorial and todo app
- 1.0 adding edit capabilities, building animated gif, submission
- 4.0 conversion to sqlite using ActiveAndroid (on spotty internet connection)
- 2.0 spinner widget for priority
- 1.0 optimizations and code cleanup

### Notes

Everything was pretty straightforward. The most time consuming part was getting
the IDE and build envionment downloaded and configured correctly. Instructions were
good, thanks! I built this while traveling on the Italian coast. The spotty internet
made it more time-consuming to solve issues..  ;)
